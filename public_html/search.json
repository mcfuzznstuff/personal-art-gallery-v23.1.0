In the years to come I'd like to continue to work remotely, which has allowed me to grow and have marvelous experiences, but until then I look forward to continuing to improve my skillsets as a professional and a hobbyist. In my free time I practice the art of balancing my time between family, school and hobbies. As a professional who’s transitioned from software engineer to product management I draw on various background experience\nto execute data driven decisions, no matter the scale.","STUDENT","PROFESSIONAL","BLOG","JUMP TO PAGE","CONTACT","This website makes use of cookies.

With an entrepreneurial mindset, 20 years of customer facing service and technical support experience and, roles held in Software Engineering and Product Ownership, I regularly draw not only on professional networking and upskilling, but also on my own experiences helping my clients navigate to the most efficient solution to meet their business goals. When we work together, your goals become my goals, allowing you to continue to focus your expertise on what you do best, your business. I'm an action-oriented, driven, and passionate person that genuinely cares about helping small businesses succeed.","What values do I operate by?","My goal is make my clients feel at home with me, like you are speaking with a professional friend or family member who just happens to be the right kind of technically inclined to help them achieve their business goals, or set new ones by showing them how their site can work more effectively procuring more business.\n\n\n\n","TRUST: My goal is make my clients feel at home with me, like are speaking with a professional friend or family member who just happens to be the right kind of technically inclined to help them achieve their business goals, or set new ones by showing them how their site can work more effectively procuring more business.\n\nTRANSPARENCY: I’m not going to hide the uncomfortable stuff from my clients, if there’s a feature they ask for that is not in my wheel house, I will share that with my clients, however, I also am a tenacious can-doer with a strong desire to learn how to deliver on something my clients truly want\/need, and if I am just not the right fit I'm not afraid let them know.\n\nPARTNERSHIP: I want my clients to be apart of the process as much or as little as they'd like. Technology is not easy, but I understand the drive and need to learn about it, I want to be my clients' partner in inspiring a real sense of ownership in my clients over the technology they employ to do the business that they love.\n\nQUALITY: Not only do I aspire to give my clients, small business owners, a quality, personable, and professional experience but I know that my work directly touches their customers as well, so providing a quality easy to manage technological experience with the same or similar look and feel as working with my clients in person is a top priority.\n\nEFFICIENCY: My clients are busy people with families, day to day business functions as well as other activities that pull their attention in all directions, I seek to respect my clients time by being efficient in not only our communications, but also in our personal interactions. Meetings are set with a purpose, a clear goal we are working towards; clients are inundated with contact from electronic and snail mail, I don't want to add to all that, so my business operates entirely virtually and with minimal but optimal conversations about goals, invoicing, etc..\n\nFLEXIBILITY: Not all small businesses are made equally, nor should the experience they receive be. Each of my clients have distinct needs, income, time, etc., I'll do my best to work with you and your particular situation whether is schedule, payments arrangements, or extra support with technology. This process shouldn't be a burden, it's a new way to make your business stronger and have a greater, wider impact in the twenty first century.","What are my clients saying, and some examples.","BEFORE","AFTER","BEFORE","AFTER","Label 5","“You are doing a great job… [w]e have gotten great feedback from staff about the updates so it is pretty exciting stuff.” \n~ Todd Deck of \nTehama County Library","“…[T]hank you for getting [the Contact Us email of our current site] fixed quickly! …I like the direction we’re going.” \n~ Jessica of \nGEN-TECH, Inc.","“I highly recommend Stephanie for any of your product or web teams.\"  ~ Mechelle Martz-Mayfield \nTrackVia, Inc.
