# personal-art-gallery-v23.1.0
This project will have serveral goals and desired outcomes which will be outlined in wiki and other documentation. The main page that will house this on my personal/professional site is [here](http://thestephaniemiranda.com/art-gallery.html).

## Plan

üí´ Vision
The result will be a place where I can easily upload my own art for on demand printing by visitors of my site, more specifically this Art Gallery page. The first version requires visitors to email me directly, which is not ideal, especially given the Print-On-Demand (POD) service I've chosen to use, MPix. Version two, this version, will "step-it-up," by allowing visitors to the gallery to perform the activities as outlined in the Goals section below while avoiding the pitfalls and scope creep that the Anti-Goals section outlines.<br>

## üéØÔ∏è Goals
- [ ]  A generic vanilla JS that can be integrated into an external print-on-demand (POD) API.
- [ ]  Ideally able to be used as a Webhook for React Applications. - Bonus
- [ ]  Visitors should be able to:
- [ ]  Check out on their own.
- [ ]  Manage a Cart (full CRUD).
- [ ]  Manage Tracking - Bonus.
- [ ]  Access customer Service (ideally not me).

## ‚õî Anti-Goals
- [ ]  Build a full-fledged React application.
- [ ]  Pay for any more services until $500 in profit/sales is reached.
- [ ]  Set up analytics for v2.0. V1.0 is live and can be found here.

## üìà Results - KPI's
- [ ] v23.1.0 MAIN OUTCOME ~NOW: Complete 1 sale, e2e, without needing to interact with the customer.
