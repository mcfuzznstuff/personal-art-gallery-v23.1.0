# personal-art-gallery-v23.1.0
This project will have several goals and desired outcomes which will be outlined in the wiki and other documentation. The main page that will house this on my personal/professional site is [here](http://thestephaniemiranda.com/art-gallery.html).

## Plan

üí´ Vision
The result will be a place where I can easily upload my own art for on-demand printing by visitors to my site, more specifically this Art Gallery page. The first version requires visitors to email me directly, which is not ideal, especially given the Print-On-Demand (POD) service I've chosen to use, MPix. Version two, this version, will "step-it-up," by allowing visitors to the gallery to perform the activities as outlined in the Goals section below while avoiding the pitfalls and scope creep that the Anti-Goals section outlines.<br>

## üéØÔ∏è Goals
- [x]  A generic vanilla JS that can be integrated into an external print-on-demand (POD) API.
- [ ]  Ideally able to be used as a Webhook for React Applications. - Bonus
- [ ]  Visitors should be able to:
- [ ]  Check out on their own.
- [ ]  Manage a Cart (full CRUD).
- [ ]  Manage Tracking - Bonus.
- [ ]  Access customer Service (ideally not me).

## ‚õî Anti-Goals
- [ ]  Build a full-fledged React application.
- [ ]  Pay for any more services until $500 in profit/sales is reached.
- [ ]  Set up analytics for v2.0. V1.0 is live and can be found here.

## üìà Results - KPI's
- [ ] v23.1.0 MAIN OUTCOME ~NOW: Complete 1 sale, e2e, without needing to interact with the customer.

## Other Phase 0 Documentation

#### Research
The earliest Discovery/Research was done in OneNote. More research and progress can be followed via a Trello Board, that I'm happy to review live upon scheduling time via my Calendly.
