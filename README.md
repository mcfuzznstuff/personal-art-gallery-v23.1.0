# personal-art-gallery-v23.1.0
This project will have several goals and desired outcomes which will be outlined in the wiki and other documentation. The main page that will house this on my personal/professional site is [here](http://thestephaniemiranda.com/art-gallery.html).

## Plan

üí´ Vision
The result will be a place where I can easily upload my own art for on-demand printing by visitors to my site, more specifically this Art Gallery page. The first version requires visitors to email me directly, which is not ideal, especially given the Print-On-Demand (POD) service I've chosen to use, MPix. Version two, this version, will "step-it-up," by allowing visitors to the gallery to perform the activities as outlined in the Goals section below while avoiding the pitfalls and scope creep that the Anti-Goals section outlines.<br>
#### Quote: "By failing to prepare you are preparing for failure." ~ Benjamin Franklin

## üéØÔ∏è Goals
- [x]  A generic vanilla JS that can be integrated into an external print-on-demand (POD) API.
- [x]  Ideally able to be used as a Webhook for React Applications. - Bonus
- [x]  Visitors should be able to:
    - [x]  Check out on their own.
    - [x]  Manage a Cart (full CRUD). 
    - [x]  Manage Tracking - Bonus.
    - [x]  Access customer Service (ideally not me).

## ‚õî Anti-Goals
- [x]  Build a full-fledged React application.
- [x]  ~~Pay for any more services until $500 in profit/sales is reached.~~ Had to pay a minimum fee for Peecho API calls, then purchases will "fill" my bank from which I can then draw and use as a pool for future API calls.
- [x]  Set up analytics for v2.0. V1.0 is live and can be found here. _The are some basic keys installed, as noted in the Privacy Policy, but nothing else was done for this version._

## üìà Results - KPIs
- [ ] v23.1.0 MAIN OUTCOME **NOW**: Complete 1 sale, e2e, without needing to interact with the customer.

## Other Phase 0 Documentation

#### Research
The earliest Discovery/Research was done in OneNote. More research and progress can be followed via a Trello Board, which I'm happy to review live upon scheduling time via my Calendly.

Feel free to [schedule 30 minutes](https://calendly.com/stephanie-4lq/30min) for a live review of this project's Trello Boards with Steph.

### üî≠ Retrospective

This is a part of the Agile process, and since I have no other team members I answered these questions myself whereas typically I'd hold a team meeting in which team members add their answers to an ongoing doc of some sort and we review/discuss as a team. The final section, "Plan of action," is something I like to include to ensure iterating is happening.
 
#### üòä What went well?
- Found a decent API that was easy to connect to with the capabilities of iterating later to be more customized.
- See GitHub, but ALL Goals met, though no sales as of 12/14/2023, except having to spend any more money.
- Had to provide a base bank for initial API calls, and ordering prints with zero discount.
#### üòê What could have been better?
- More clear/robust plan of action and documentation along the way.
- Completing Phase 1 quicker would have allowed me more time to order samples before the holiday season.
#### ü§î What's been learned?
- Just because I'm wearing ALL the hats of a project, doesn't mean I can/should skip steps that are not "entertaining," or not a part of my current corporate persona role.
- Clearly defining the personas and their journeys will help in iterations. (a part of the NEXT version/iteration of this project.)
#### ü§ì Plan of action
- Use ChatGPT to help create user stories based on personas and journeys defined in this project's [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMouX5qk=/).
